# project_4_shroomin

For this project the overall goal was to find a dataset that we could perform modeling on and hopefullt end up with an accuracy score close to 1.000. 

Before we began we had to find a dataset that we could use, we decided that the dataset from UC Irving of Mushrooms would be an interesting topic and could be easily modeled. 

Within a pandas notebook we imported the mushroom data, created a dataframe, and went on the run some testing a modeling. By using several layers with varying unit amounts we were able to model the data and come to an accuracy score of 1.00 which we were very happy with. We did also test different unit amounts and epochs but the outcome was the same. 

Once we were happy with the acccuracy score we created several visualizations with the data. 

The visualizations and the prior code was uploaded to our website were it can all be easily accessed along with a link to our dataset and someother fun testing for the consumer.
